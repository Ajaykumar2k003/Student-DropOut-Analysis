# Student Dropout Analysis for School Education

## Overview
This project aims to analyze factors contributing to student dropouts in school education using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key indicators that lead to student dropouts and to build predictive models to assist in proactive intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention). It includes various features like student demographics, academic performance, and more.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key patterns in the data.
- **Modeling:** Implemented several machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and SVM to predict student dropout rates.
- **Evaluation:** Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The analysis highlighted significant factors affecting student dropouts, and the models provided valuable insights into predicting dropouts with reasonable accuracy.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Plotly

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TitanNatesan/StudentDropOutAnalysis.git 
cd StudentDropOutAnalysis
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

#### Windows:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook

- Open the Jupyter Notebook in VS Code.
- Ensure the kernel is set to the `.venv` environment you created.
- Run the cells to perform the analysis and view the results.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of factors leading to student dropouts and demonstrates how machine learning can be utilized to predict and potentially mitigate these dropouts.
