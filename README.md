# Student Dropout Analysis for School Education

## Overview
This project aims to analyze factors contributing to student dropouts in school education using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key indicators that lead to student dropouts and to build predictive models to assist in proactive intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention). It includes various features like student demographics, academic performance, and more.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key patterns in the data.
- **Modeling:** Implemented several machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and SVM to predict student dropout rates.
- **Evaluation:** Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The analysis highlighted significant factors affecting student dropouts, and the models provided valuable insights into predicting dropouts with reasonable accuracy.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
